Is the behaviour of an event, another event, the outcome?

Can events be created with mathematical operations, to produce new results?

I'm a big fan of the work by Nathan Marz on Rama, see this blog post:

I have an intuition that behaviour can be parallelised but I'm trying to work out how.

I am trying to study the relationship of numbers to work out if there is a relationship that can be hooked into to provide for parallelisable behaviour.
